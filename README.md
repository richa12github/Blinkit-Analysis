Data Analytic Project
In this project, I explored and visualized key business metrics using Excel, SQL, and Power BI to gain insights into online retail data.📑

Key objectives included:-📌

1)-Total Sales Analysis📊

2)-Average Sales per Transaction📈

3)-Number of Items Sold📊

4)-Average Product Ratings📈

Using SQL, I cleaned and queried the dataset to extract meaningful patterns, and with Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data cleaning, aggregation, and storytelling through visual analytics.🎯
